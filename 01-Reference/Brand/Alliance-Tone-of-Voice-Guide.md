## II. VOICE CHARACTERISTICS

### The Alliance Voice: Four Pillars

#### 1. PRINCIPLED (Not Rigid)

We stand firmly on core values without wavering, but we're not dogmatic. We're ideologically consistent but pragmatically flexible on implementation.

**In Practice:**
✅ **Do:** "We believe all people deserve secure employment and a living wage."
✅ **Do:** "We've consistently opposed privatization for over 30 years."
✅ **Do:** "Public ownership works - we've proven it before, we can do it again."

❌ **Don't:** "This is the only way and anyone who disagrees is wrong."
❌ **Don't:** Use language that implies ideological purity tests
❌ **Don't:** Dismiss legitimate concerns or alternative viewpoints

- Clear red lines (what we won't compromise)
- Open to coalition and collaboration within principles

---

#### 2. ACCESSIBLE (Not Populist)

---

#### 4. HOPEFUL (Not Naive)

---

## IV. TONE VARIATIONS BY CONTEXT

### Homepage / Main Messaging
**Tone:** Inspirational, aspirational, welcoming
**Length:** Concise, punchy
**Purpose:** Create immediate connection to values

**Example:**
> "A country that works for working people. Where everyone has secure employment, free healthcare and education, affordable housing, and a real say in decisions that affect their lives. Together, we can build it."

---

### Policy Pages
**Tone:** Clear, authoritative, practical

2. **Principle:** Our core value on this issue
3. **Solution:** Our policy position (specific and actionable)
4. **Evidence:** Why this works (historical or international examples)
5. **Impact:** How this benefits working people

**Example Opening:**
> **Public Ownership of Essential Services**
>
> New Zealanders pay too much for electricity, water, and telecommunications while private companies extract profits. These essential services should serve people, not shareholders.
>
> We will return essential infrastructure to public ownership, ensuring affordable access for all while generating revenue for public services instead of private profits.

---

### News / Blog Posts

- **Alliance perspective:** How we see it differently
- **Action or position:** What should be done
- **Call to engagement:** How readers can respond

**Example Opening:**
> The government's announcement of another round of public sector cuts shows they've learned nothing from decades of failed neoliberal economics. Working people need more public services, not fewer - and we need to fund them by taxing wealth, not cutting jobs.

---

### Social Media

>
> "Public ownership worked for generations. Then we sold it off and prices soared. Let's bring it back. #PublicOwnership #ForTheCommonGood"

---

---

**Length:** Standard press release format
**Purpose:** Get coverage, shape narrative, position Alliance

- Contact information

**Example Quote Style:**
> "Working New Zealanders can't afford another three years of policies that benefit asset-holders at the expense of wage-earners," said [Alliance Spokesperson]. "We're offering a real alternative: public ownership, progressive taxation, and economic security for all."

---

## V. WRITING PRINCIPLES

### Sentence Structure

**Keep it Simple:**
- Average 15-20 words per sentence
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- One main idea per sentence
- Active voice preferred
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)

✅ **Good:** "Free healthcare benefits everyone. It removes the financial barrier to getting treatment when you need it."

❌ **Too Complex:** "The implementation of a comprehensive, universally accessible healthcare system would facilitate the removal of economic impediments to medical treatment access."

---

### Paragraph Structure

**Scannable and Logical:**
- First sentence = topic/main point
- Supporting sentences develop the idea
- Last sentence = transition or conclusion
- Use subheadings liberally
- Break up long text with lists
- Use bold for key terms (sparingly)

---

### Inclusive Language

**Gender:**
- Use "they/their" for singular when gender unknown
- Avoid assuming gender in examples
- Use "Chair" not "Chairman"
- "Spokesperson" not "spokesman"

**Disability:**
- Person-first language ("person with disability" not "disabled person")
- Avoid ableist metaphors ("turn a blind eye," "falls on deaf ears")
- Describe without pity or inspiration porn

**Cultural:**
- Use "Aotearoa New Zealand" in formal contexts
- Respect te reo Māori (macrons, correct pronunciation)
- Acknowledge bicultural foundation
- Don't appropriate or tokenize

**Economic:**
- "Working people" includes unemployed, caregivers, disabled
- Avoid "taxpayer" language (excludes many)
- Don't create deserving/undeserving poor distinction
- Acknowledge unpaid labor (care work, community work)

---

### Numbers and Data

**Make Them Concrete:**
- Use statistics sparingly
- Round for readability ($10 million not $9,847,652)
- Give context (percentages need baseline)
- Make relatable (per person, per week)

✅ **Good:** "CEOs now earn 50 times what their average worker makes"
✅ **Good:** "That's an extra $50 a week for a typical family"

❌ **Bad:** "A 3.2% increase in the marginal rate for the upper quintile"

---

### Calls to Action

**Be Clear and Direct:**
- Action verb first
- Explain why
- Make it easy
- Create urgency where appropriate
- Don't pressure

✅ **Strong CTAs:**
- "Join the Alliance today"
- "Sign up for our newsletter"
- "Contact your MP about this issue"
- "Share this if you agree"
- "Come to our next meeting"

❌ **Weak CTAs:**
- "Learn more" (about what?)
- "Click here" (why?)
- "Get involved" (how?)

---

## VI. VOICE IN PRACTICE: EXAMPLES

### Before & After: Homepage Hero

**Before (Generic):**
> "The Alliance Party is committed to making positive changes for New Zealand through progressive policies and community engagement."

**After (Alliance Voice):**
> "A country that works for working people. Where secure jobs, free healthcare, affordable housing, and real democracy aren't just dreams—they're rights. Together, we can build it."

**Why It Works:**
- Concrete benefits (not vague "positive changes")
- Aspirational but specific
- Collective framing ("together")
- Action-oriented ("build it")

---

### Before & After: Policy Statement

**Before (Wonkish):**
> "The Alliance proposes a comprehensive reform of the taxation system to increase revenue collection from high-net-worth individuals while providing relief to low and middle-income earners."

**After (Alliance Voice):**
> "Our tax system is rigged in favor of the wealthy. Those who can most afford to contribute pay the least, while working people carry the burden. We'll fix that with a progressive tax system that asks more from asset-holders and less from wage-earners. It's not complicated—it's fair."

**Why It Works:**
- Identifies the problem clearly
- Uses accessible language
- Appeals to fairness
- Concrete proposal
- Acknowledges simplicity (counters "too complex" objection)

---

### Before & After: News Response

**Before (Academic):**
> "The government's austerity measures represent a continuation of neoliberal economic orthodoxy that has demonstrably failed to produce equitable outcomes."

**After (Alliance Voice):**
> "Cutting public services didn't work in the 1990s, it didn't work in the 2010s, and it won't work now. Working people need more support, not less. We need to fund our public services by taxing wealth, not cutting jobs."

**Why It Works:**
- Historical grounding
- Clear position
- People-focused (not abstract)
- Solution offered
- Accessible language

---

### Before & After: Call to Action

**Before (Transactional):**
> "Fill out the form below to receive more information about Alliance Party membership."

**After (Alliance Voice):**
> "Join thousands of New Zealanders building a fairer country. No corporate donors, no hidden agendas—just people who believe we can do better. Add your voice today."

**Why It Works:**
- Community framing (not individual transaction)
- Differentiation (no corporate donors)
- Aspirational purpose
- Invitation, not demand

---

## VII. COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

✅ **Use:** Explain context, provide background, meet people where they are

---

### 3. Negativity Without Hope

✅ **Use:** "Things are bad, but together we can change them"

---

### 4. Tribalism and Purity

✅ **Use:** "We believe [position] because [values], and welcome dialogue"

---

### 5. Defensive or Apologetic

❌ **Avoid:** "We know public ownership sounds extreme, but..."
✅ **Use:** "Public ownership works. We've proven it before."

---

### 6. Corporate-Speak

❌ **Avoid:** "Leveraging synergies to deliver outcomes for stakeholders"
✅ **Use:** "Working together to make life better for New Zealanders"

---

### 7. Vagueness

❌ **Avoid:** "We support positive change and better outcomes"
✅ **Use:** "Free healthcare, secure jobs, affordable housing"

---

### 8. Talking Past People
