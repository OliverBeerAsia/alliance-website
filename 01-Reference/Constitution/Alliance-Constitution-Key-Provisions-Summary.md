## IV. LEADERSHIP MODEL

### Co-Leadership System

**Two Co-Leaders:**

---

## XV. NOTABLE CONSTITUTIONAL FEATURES

### 1. Explicit Socialism
Unlike many left parties that downplay ideology, Alliance Constitution explicitly states: "party of the left with policies based on **socialist principles**" and Principle #10 commits to "fight for a **socialist alternative** for society."

### 2. Co-Leadership Model
Two Co-Leaders (not single leader) promotes collective leadership and can ensure diverse representation.

### 3. President Cannot Be MP
Ensures organizational leadership independent from parliamentary pressures. President can attend caucus but isn't beholden to parliamentary dynamics.

### 4. Formal Faction Rights
Section 6 allows affiliated groups/networks—unusual for most parties but consistent with "unite socialists and social democrats from all traditions."

### 5. Extra-Parliamentary Focus
Objective #1 is to "organise and fight for Alliance Party principles and policies **outside Parliament**" (before winning seats). Reflects movement-building approach.

### 6. Public Ownership Specificity
Constitution names specific sectors for public ownership (water, electricity, telecommunications, railways, shipping, ports, airports)—unusual specificity.

### 7. Treaty Constitutional Status
Te Tiriti is a constitutional principle, not just a policy position. Embedded in candidate selection criteria and list composition requirements.

### 8. Member-Driven Policy
Policy must be approved by Conference after discussion in branches and regional conferences. Prevents leadership from unilaterally changing policy.

### 9. Coalition Control
Conference must approve coalition agreements and Council confirms Cabinet ministers—parliamentary caucus can't unilaterally enter government.

### 10. Anti-Capitalism as Principle
Principle #10 explicitly challenges "global capitalism"—ideologically clear, not centrist triangulation.

8. **How to balance electoral work with extra-parliamentary organizing** per constitutional objectives?

9. **How to recruit young members** given 13-year minimum age?

- Clear ideological foundation
- Member-driven decision-making
- Accountable parliamentary representatives
- Commitment to extra-parliamentary organizing
- Constitutional Treaty partnership
- Explicit public ownership agenda
- Welcome for diverse left traditions

This constitutional framework should inform **all** organizational work, messaging, policy development, and public communication. The party's democratic character, socialist principles, and member control are not just rhetoric—they're constitutional requirements.

**For communications:** Authentically reflect these constitutional values. The Alliance is not trying to hide its socialist character or blur its distinctiveness. It's a democratic socialist party building a movement for fundamental change.

**For organizing:** Emphasize branches, democratic participation, policy development from grassroots, and the power of Conference. This isn't a top-down organization—the Constitution prevents that.

**For policy:** Ground all positions in the 10 core principles. Test proposals against these constitutional foundations. Ensure Treaty partnership is embedded, not tokenistic.

The Constitution is the party's DNA. Know it, follow it, and use it to demonstrate what makes the Alliance genuinely different from other political parties.
