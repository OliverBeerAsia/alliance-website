# **2\.	PRINCIPLES**

The Alliance Party is a party of the left with policies based on socialist principles of democracy, equality and social ownership. 

**The Alliance Party principles are:**

1. All people should enjoy secure, well-paid work; high-quality, free education and healthcare; affordable housing and power; a safe, sustainable environment; and the right to make decisions about their lives and communities. 

   2. A productive, environmentally sustainable economy operated in the interests of all New Zealanders to ensure secure well-paid jobs and a fair distribution of wealth. Achieving this means returning to public ownership and control of key national and local assets, especially of water, electricity, telecommunications, railways, coastal shipping, ports, and airports.  

   3. All workers are entitled to meaningful work without exploitation and to a secure wage for themselves and their families, to form unions to advocate for their interests, while also recognising the contribution of unpaid work.

   4. Every person is entitled to the income and resources needed to fully participate in society and the purpose of the social welfare system is to guarantee this.

   5. Wealth should be redistributed through means such as a highly progressive taxation system to achieve a just and equitable society without poverty or discrimination. 

   6. Te Tiriti is the basis for a genuine partnership between tangata whenua and all other people in Aotearoa New Zealand. Land and other grievances must be redressed, Māori customary rights safeguarded, and Māoritanga and Te Reo promoted as the first culture and language of Aotearoa New Zealand.

   7. The society we envisage in one in which racism, sectarianism, homophobia, ageism and discrimination against women and people with disabilities have no place, where diversity is recognised as a strength and each individual’s contribution is valued, and where every person is treated with respect in accordance with their basic human rights.

   

   8. The destruction of our natural environment must be halted and we must actively promote its restoration and protection. A prosperous economy and a stable society in the future requires a natural world in balance.

   9. Aotearoa New Zealand must play a positive role globally with an independent foreign policy that promotes social justice, peaceful resolution of conflicts and opposes all wars of aggression. We should strengthen our ties with our Pacific neighbours.

   10. Global capitalism is not permanent or invincible – we must challenge that conventional assumption and fight for a socialist alternative for society.

**3\. 	OBJECTIVES**

**The objectives of the Alliance Party are:**

1. To organise and fight for Alliance Party principles and policies outside Parliament.

   2. To contest Parliamentary and local body elections as an independent party of the left as a platform for winning support for Alliance Party principles and policies, and building a mass democratic party.

   3. To win seats in Parliament and on local authorities to enable us to implement Alliance Party policies.

   4. To unite socialists and social democrats from all traditions, allowing different ideas and perspectives to be discussed within the Party in an environment of tolerance and respect. This includes the ability to create formal factions (affiliated groups and networks) within the Party.

   5. To build links in solidarity with all those resisting inequality and injustice around the world.
