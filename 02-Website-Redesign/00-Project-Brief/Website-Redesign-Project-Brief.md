# Alliance Party Website Redesign - Project Brief

## Executive Summary

This project brief outlines the ground-up redesign of allianceparty.nz within WordPress, transforming the current generic template site into a modern, conversion-optimised political platform that authentically reflects the Alliance Party's democratic socialist values and constitutional principles.

The redesign will address critical deficiencies in visibility, content depth, and user engagement, building a web presence capable of supporting the party's dual mission: contesting elections and organising for change outside Parliament.

**Timeline:** February - August 2026 (6 months)

## Current State Baseline

| Aspect | Current State |
|--------|---------------|
| **Platform** | WordPress CMS with Astra theme |
| **Domain Rating** | 0.0/100 |
| **Organic Keywords** | 2 ("the alliance", "alliance") |
| **Organic Traffic** | ~1 visitor/month |
| **Backlinks** | 2 from 2 referring domains |
| **Design** | Clean but generic, text-heavy, minimal visual impact |
| **Content** | Limited depth beyond homepage |
| **Navigation** | Home, News, About, Contact, What we stand for, Get Involved |
| **Brand Colour** | Burgundy #821918 |
| **Hero Message** | "A country that works for working people" |
| **Responsive** | Yes, breakpoints at 921px and 544px |

The current site presents a critical visibility gap. With a Domain Rating of 0.0 and virtually no organic traffic, the Alliance Party has no meaningful digital presence in search. The site functions as a placeholder rather than an active organising and communication tool.

## Design Inspiration Sources

### US Progressive Sites
Bold visual storytelling, strong calls to action, movement-building energy. Sites like those of Bernie Sanders, AOC, and progressive organisations demonstrate how political websites can feel alive with purpose. Key takeaways: large hero imagery, prominent volunteer/donate CTAs, personal storytelling, and campaign momentum visuals.

### EU Democratic Socialist Parties
Mature party platforms offering policy depth, multilingual considerations, and coalition-building messaging. European social democratic and democratic socialist parties (e.g., Labour (UK), SPD (Germany), Podemos (Spain)) balance substantive policy content with accessible design. Key takeaways: structured policy libraries, strong information architecture, credible and institutional yet approachable design.

### NZ Government Sites
Accessibility excellence, clean information architecture, bilingual (English/Te Reo) integration, and trusted civic design patterns. Sites like govt.nz and health.govt.nz set a high standard for clarity and accessibility. Key takeaways: plain language, logical content hierarchy, excellent mobile experiences, and bilingual design patterns that feel natural rather than bolted on.

---

## Core Design Principles

1. **Accessibility-first** - WCAG 2.1 AA minimum across all pages and components. Screen reader friendly, keyboard navigable, sufficient colour contrast, and clear focus indicators. No information conveyed by colour alone.

2. **Conversion-optimised** - Every page has a clear next action. Whether it is joining the party, volunteering, donating, or reading further, the user is always guided toward meaningful engagement.

3. **Performance-focused** - Core Web Vitals passing on all page types. Fast on mobile and rural connections where bandwidth may be limited. Performance is an accessibility issue.

4. **Authentically Alliance** - Design reflects democratic socialist values: collective, bold, hopeful. The visual language should feel distinctly Alliance, not interchangeable with any other political party. Ground design decisions in the party's 10 constitutional principles.

5. **Content-forward** - Design serves content, not the reverse. Typography, spacing, and layout prioritise readability and comprehension. Policy substance is the product; design is the delivery mechanism.

6. **Mobile-first** - Designed for New Zealand's mobile-heavy audience. All layouts, interactions, and content structures start from the smallest screen and scale up.

7. **Bilingual-ready** - Structure supports English and Te Reo Maori from the outset. Navigation, page templates, and content architecture accommodate bilingual content without retrofitting. This reflects the party's constitutional commitment to genuine Treaty partnership.

## WordPress-Specific Considerations

### Theme Approach
The decision between developing a custom theme and customising a premium theme will be finalised during Phase 2. Factors to evaluate:
- **Custom theme:** Maximum control, no bloat, tailored to exact requirements. Higher initial development cost.
- **Premium theme customisation:** Faster development, established codebase, potential for bloat and dependency on third-party updates.

### Page Builder
Evaluate during Phase 5:
- **Gutenberg blocks:** Native WordPress, lightweight, future-proof. More limited design flexibility.
- **Elementor or similar:** Greater design flexibility, drag-and-drop editing for non-technical users. Performance overhead and plugin dependency.

### Plugin Ecosystem
- Minimise plugins for performance and security
- Prefer well-maintained, actively developed plugins with strong community support
- Essential plugin categories: SEO, caching, security, forms, analytics, image optimisation
- Document all plugins with justification for inclusion

### Hosting
- Evaluate current hosting for performance requirements
- Consider NZ-based or Australasian hosting for latency optimisation
- Requirements: PHP 8.1+, MySQL 8.0+, SSL certificate, automated backups, staging environment

### Caching Strategy
- Server-level caching (if hosting supports)
- Plugin-based page caching and object caching
- Browser caching with appropriate cache headers
- CDN consideration for static assets

### Image Optimisation
- WebP format as primary, with JPEG/PNG fallbacks
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- Responsive images using srcset
- Maximum upload size guidelines
- Automated compression on upload

### Security
- Keep WordPress core, themes, and plugins updated promptly
- Implement security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Two-factor authentication for admin accounts
- Regular backup schedule with off-site storage
- Limit login attempts and enforce strong passwords
